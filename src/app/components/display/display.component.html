<p>After our components have been separated, there will come times when events need to be passed from
    component to component. To do this, we will need to define custom events within Angular using the EventEmitter. The
    HTML template for the button-menu component will contain two buttons, both of which have click events bound to
    handler methods. The TS file, however, has an EventEmitter object attached to the @Output decorator: this allows
    the component to 'emit' an event to the parent component. this is done in the increment() method.</p>

    
<div class="todo-container">
    <p>You can see that in the display component, incrementEvent is a custom event bound to the display method's own
    handler. Your task is to fill out the functionality needed for a working decrement button - that will entail
    creating
    an EventEmitter in the button-menu component, emitting the event in the decrement() method of button-menu, and
    binding
    the custom event to the doDecrement() method of the display component in its HTML tempalte.</p>

    <p>Count: {{num}}</p>
    <!--TODO: after setting up the EventEmitter in the button-menu component, bind the new event to this component.-->
    <app-button-menu (incrementEvent)="doIncrement()"  (decrementEvent)="doDecrement()"> </app-button-menu>

</div>
